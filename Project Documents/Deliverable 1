Idea 1: Projectile Game using smooth animations and game physics <= Chosen Idea

Idea 2: Physics engine


Section 1: Executive summary
[Name] is a 2D projectile game made purely for interactive entertainment offering a fun and challenging experience. The main idea behind Ballistic Odyssey is centered around the concept of trying to shoot a computer enemy using different kinds of weapons and power ups.
The game will feature an immersive user interface which will let players easily navigate the game and choose their own customizable UI settings. In addition, [Name] will also implement progressive difficulty levels as well as an enemy 
difficulty and a scoring system to determine the player’s skills and abilities. This scoring system will add depth to the game itself and the player’s experience as it will make him have a competitive spirit and encourage him to play more.

Section 3: Solutions and approach
In order to provide a fun and immersive gaming experience for the user, the 2D projectile game will heavily focus on implementing many key features and mechanics to engage interaction and overall enjoyable gameplay .

Such features and mechanics include the following:
App divided into two modes: the Game (which is the main part of the app) and education Mode where the user can discover the math and physics behind the game, and do some simultauions.
-play against Other player or computer
-computer has various difficulties
-game will be played at multiple scales : human scale-astronomical scale.
-Multiple levels (Increasing difficulty as levels go up)
-Certain obstacles used for protection
-Engaging interactions (drag and release mechanism to launch grenade,spear,smoke ect...)
-Game Physics (Factors such as velocity, and acceleration, wind resistance, friction drag force in water ect...)
-Power ups (Making the projectile weapon faster, more damage,ect..)
-A time limit per player called a "turn". (30 seconds to make a choice)
-Variety of classes and loadouts (Light class, medium class, heavy class)
-Medium class includes a rail gun able to shoot through thin obstacles (straight direction),smoke grenades, an impact grenades.
-Light class includes a spear, a projectile grenade launching other grenades on impact.
-Heavy class includes a mortar, smoke grenades, impact grenades.
-Max of 2 grenades for each type, main weapon is unlimited.
-Smoke grenades able to hide from other people.
-Theme mode (Light/dark)
-Access to previous levels and new levels
-Making the player be able to jump to one position to another each "turn" for a certain range of distance using projectile motion (There will be a max distance that the character can jump to)
-Zooms on projectiles and characters

Section 4: Physic Topics
-Projectile motion (KE, PE)
-Newtonian gravitational force
-Vectors algebra

(optional)
-Mechanics (impulse)
-Fluid dynamics
-Waves
-Special relativity
